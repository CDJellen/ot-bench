## Datasets

This directory contains data used in `otbench` regression and forecasting tasks. Existing datasets are serialized in the NetCDF4 format and seek to comply with the CF conventions. As such, each dataset is self-describing, but also includes a `README.md` file with additional information and a `citation.md` file with a suggested citation. The `README.md` file is intended to be human-readable, while the `citation.md` file is intended to be machine-readable.
